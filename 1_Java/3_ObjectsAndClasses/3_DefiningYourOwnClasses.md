In the previous chapter, you started writing simple classes. However, all those classes had just a single `main` method. Now the time has come to show you how to write the kind of "workhorse classes" that are needed for more sophisticated applications. These classes typically do not have a `main` method. Instead, they have their own instance fields and methods. To build a complete program, you combine several classes, one of which has a `main` method.
