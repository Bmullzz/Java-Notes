# Operators

Java uses the the usual operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

- `+`: addition

- `-`: subtraction

- `*`: multiplication

- `/`: division
    - The `/` operator denotes _integer_ division if **both** arguments are integers, and _floating-point_ division otherwise.

- `%`: modulus (Integer remainder)
    - Integer remainder (sometimes called _modulus_) is denoted by `%`.
    - For example, `15 / 2` is `7`, `15 % 2` is `1`, and `15.0 / 2` is `7.5`.

Note that _integer division_ by `0` raises an **exception**, whereas _floating-point division_ by `0` yields an **infinite** or **NaN** result.
