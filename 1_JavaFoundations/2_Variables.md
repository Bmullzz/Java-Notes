# Java Variables

In Java, every variable has a _type_. You declare a variable by placing the type first, followed by the name of the variable. Here are some examples:

```java
double salary;
int vacationDays;
long earthPopulation;
boolean done;
```

Notice the semicolon at the end of each declaration. The semicolon is necessary because a declaration is a complete Java statement.

A variable name must begin with a letter and must be a sequence of letters or digits.

- Note: If you are really curious as to what Unicode characters are "letters" as far as Java is concerned, you can use the `isJavaIdentifierStart` and `isJavaIdentifierPart` methods in the `Character` class to check.

- Note: Even though `$` is a valid JAva letter, you should not use it in you own code. It is intended for names that are generated by the Java compiler and other tools.
